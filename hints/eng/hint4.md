## Interpreting the line graph

4 important elements are found in the graphic:

- There is a line for each treatment.
- Y axis indicates the gene expression mean of each gene (on the X axis).
- It is possible to choose the order of the genes in X axis: Decreasing by treatment, alphabetically by funcionality genetic, or both criteria.
- If there are genes in which *the average expression presents significant differences between treatments*, there will be discontinous vertical lines in the positions where these genes are.

With this graph we can see: The mean differences between treatments, the gens that has significant variables on average (ANOVA and Tukey table), possible clusters for significant genes funcionality (if the discontinous lines have more funcionalities than others), *positively correlated* treatments throughout the genes (when a line goes up and down simultaneously in most genes), *negatively correlated* treatments throughout the genes (when one line goes down, and other goes up), and *uncorrelated* treatments (no up and down pattern). 

**Obs**: The significance depends on the vertical distances between lines but it also depends on the variance, which is not displayed in the graph; thus, it is possible to see the treatments far in some genes but without discontinuous vertical line, this will indicate that the observed differences are not significant due to the variability existing within the treatments.
